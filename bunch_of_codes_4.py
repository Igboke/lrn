'''The following Python program is supposed to prompt the user to enter five integers into a list and then display, for each element, its number of digits and the integer itself. For example, if the user enters the values 35, 13565, 113, 278955, 9999, the Python program is supposed to display:
2 are the digits of 35
5 are the digits of 13565
3 are the digits of 113
6 are the digits of 278955
4 are the digits of 9999
